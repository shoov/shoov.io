title: Lesson 2 - Setup a GitHub repository
---

The following section can be used on existing repositories, but for the sake of simplicity lets create a new repository in GitHub.

Go ahead and make it public if you want, so other could educate from it.

Next we will scaffold all the needed files. For this we will use the previously installed generator-shoov. Execute the command from inside the newly created and cloned repository.

```bash
yo shoov
```



## Visual monitor first time

```bash
cd visual-monitor
PROVIDER_PREFIX=browserstack SELECTED_CAPS=chrome mocha
```

Watch the test in BrowserStack.

Open the new `webdrivercss` folder and see the baseline image.

Note when adding `git add webdriver` it will add only the files that end with baseline.png.

Re run `PROVIDER_PREFIX=browserstack SELECTED_CAPS=chrome mocha` to validate the baseline is correct. If a regression is created it means that there is dynamic content on the page that will need to be excluded or removed.

## Functional monitor first time

```bash
cd ../behat
./bin/behat
```
